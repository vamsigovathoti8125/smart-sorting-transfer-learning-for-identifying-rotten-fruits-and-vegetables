🍎 Smart Sorting: Rotten vs Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Classification Using Transfer Learning

Smart Sorting is a deep learning-powered web application designed to classify microscopic images of fruits and vegetables into fresh or rotten categories across 16 classes:

🍎 Fresh Apple, Fresh Banana, Fresh Tomato...

🥀 Rotten Apple, Rotten Banana, Rotten Tomato...


This intelligent food sorting tool leverages Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 to deliver accurate, real-time predictions through a modern Flask-based web interface.


---

🚀 How It Works

1. 📤 Upload an image of a fruit or vegetable.


2. 🤖 Model processes the image using deep learning.


3. 🧾 Prediction is displayed along with a preview of the uploaded image.



This makes Smart Sorting ideal for food sorting systems, supply chains, quality control in agriculture, and academic research.
